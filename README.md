# Remember Meow

Remember Meow was the first App I ever created! 

While attending Galvanize, my coding bootcamp, we were given an assignment to create our first app just after 4 weeks of lessons. 
Within that time I had learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

I used this new knowledge to create a memory game that has a cat theme. 

## How the game works

To play the game click "click 2 play" button located on screen. The center of the board will flip revealing cat pictures. The player will have to remember as 
many sets before the cards flip over. For every correct matched set the character will move forward. For every incorrect choice the character will move back.
Too many incorrect choices and the game is lost!
